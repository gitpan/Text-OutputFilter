=head1 NAME

OutputFilter - Enable post processing of output without fork

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Text::OutputFilter;

 my $bucket = "";
 tie *STDOUT, "Text::OutputFilter";
 tie *HANDLE, "Text::OutputFilter", 4;
 tie *HANDLE, "Text::OutputFilter", 4,  *STDOUT;
 tie *STDOUT, "Text::OutputFilter", 4, \$bucket;
 tie *OUTPUT, "Text::OutputFilter", 4,  *STDOUT, sub { "$_[0]" };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interface enables some post-processing on output streams,
like adding a left margin.

The tied filehandle is opened unbuffered, but the output is line
buffered. The C<tie> takes three optional arguments:

=over 4

=item Left Margin

The left margin must be a positive integer and defaults to C<4> spaces.

=item Output Streem

The output stream must be an already open stream, with writing
enabled. The default is C<*STDOUT>. All input methods on the new
stream are disabled. If a reference to a scalar is passed, it will
be opened as PerlIO::scalar - in-memory IO, scalar IO. No checks
performed to see if your perl supports it. If you want it, and your
perl does not, upgrade.

Using C<binmode ()> on the new stream is allowed and supported.

OPEN, SEEK, and WRITE are not (yet) implemented.

=item Line Modifying Function

The output is line buffered, to enable line-modifier functions.
The line (without newline) is passed as the only argument to the
sub-ref, whose output is printed after the prefix from the first
argument. A newline is printed after the sub-ref's output.

To B<filter> a line, as in I<remove> it from the stream, make the
sub return I<undef>.
